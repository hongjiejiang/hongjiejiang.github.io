I'm Hongjie Jiang, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computational Mathematics at Yuanpei College, Peking University. I was admitted through the Yuanpei Honors Program after winning a gold medal at the 22nd Asian Physics Olympiad, and chose to specialize in mathematics due to a growing interest in the theoretical foundations of science and computation. At the early stage of my research journey, I am fortunate to be guided by Prof. [Bin Dong](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/) at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR) and Prof. [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/index.html) at the School of Intelligence Science and Technology (SIST), PKU. I am currently working remotely with Prof. [Di Luo](https://diluo28.github.io/diluo.github.io/). You can find my CV on [this page](cv.md).

My research interests lie in scientific machine learning, especially the application of deep learning to solving partial differential equations. Iâ€™m also broadly interested in AI for science, focusing on physics-driven modeling and simulation.

I enjoy combining mathematical rigor with computational tools, and I hope to contribute to the development of interpretable and efficient methods in scientific computing. For more about my research statement, please visit [this page](research_statement.md).
