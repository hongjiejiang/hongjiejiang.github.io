I'm Hongjie Jiang, a senior student majoring in Computational Mathematics at Yuanpei College, Peking University. 

I was admitted through Honors Program after winning a gold medal at the 22nd Asian Physics Olympiad, and chose to specialize in mathematics due to a growing interest in the theoretical foundations of science and computation. At the early stage of my research journey, I am fortunate to be guided by Prof. [Bin Dong](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/) at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR) and Prof. [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/index.html) at the School of Intelligence Science and Technology (SIST), PKU. I am currently working remotely with Prof. [Di Luo](https://diluo28.github.io/diluo.github.io/). You can find my CV on [this page](cv.md).

I enjoy combining mathematical rigor with computational tools, and I hope to contribute to the development of interpretable and efficient methods in scientific computing. At present, my research interests lie in scientific machine learning, especially the application of deep learning to solving partial differential equations. Iâ€™m also broadly interested in AI for science, focusing on physics-driven modeling and simulation. For more about my research statement, please visit [this page](research_statement.md).

I always welcome discussions and collaborations. If you share similar interests or have ideas to exchange, please feel free to reach out.
