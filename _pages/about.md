About Me
=======

I'm Hongjie Jiang, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computational Mathematics at Yuanpei College, Peking University. I was admitted through the Yuanpei Honors Program after winning a gold medal at the 22nd Asian Physics Olympiad, and chose to specialize in mathematics due to a growing interest in the theoretical foundations of science and computation. At the early stage of my research journey, I am fortunate to be guided by Prof. Bin Dong at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR) and Prof. Liwei Wang at the School of Intelligence Science and Technology (SIST), PKU. I am currently working remotely with Prof. Di Luo. You can find my CV on [this page](cv.md).

My research interests lie in scientific machine learning, especially the application of deep learning to solving partial differential equations. Iâ€™m also broadly interested in AI for science, focusing on physics-driven modeling and simulation.

I enjoy combining mathematical rigor with computational tools, and I hope to contribute to the development of interpretable and efficient methods in scientific computing. For more about my research statement, please visit [this page](research_statement.md).
