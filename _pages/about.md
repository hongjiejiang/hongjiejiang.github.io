About Me
=======

I'm Hongjie Jiang, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computational Mathematics at Yuanpei College, Peking University. I was admitted through the Yuanpei Honors Program after winning a gold medal at the 22nd Asian Physics Olympiad, and chose to specialize in mathematics due to a growing interest in the theoretical foundations of science and computation. You can find my CV on [this page](cv.md).

My research interests lie in scientific machine learning, especially the application of deep learning to solving partial differential equations. Iâ€™m also broadly interested in AI for science, focusing on physics-driven modeling and data-driven simulation.

I enjoy combining mathematical rigor with computational tools, and I hope to contribute to the development of interpretable and efficient methods in scientific computing. For more about my research statement, please visit [this page](research_statement.md).

For those interested in my personal interests and reflections outside academia, please visit [this page](personal.html).
