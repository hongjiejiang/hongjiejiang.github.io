> Foundation model for 2D PDEs accepting computational graph inputs and outputting mesh-free solutions. Pretrained on 40TB data, it handles diverse PDE types/conditions with strong zero-shot capability. Achieves better accuracy than specialized models with <100 samples and enables efficient inverse problem solving.
